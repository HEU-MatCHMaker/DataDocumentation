# Semantic data documentation for MatCHMaker

Within this repository are the entities that represent (eventually all) data used in the MatCHMaker project.
It holds the "source of truth" for these entities, and as such, if updated, the entities will be uploaded for wide use in the project.

The repository also contains instance examples for these entities.

Eventually, semantic mappings will be included here, possibly also OTEAPI pipeline configurations.

All these things together completely document the data used in the MatCHMaker project in a semantic and FAIR way.
