  SEM image with elemental mappings. Represented as a stack of elemental mapping
  followed by the image formed by the back-scattered electrons (BSE).
  Set `nelements=0` if you only have the back-scattered image.
dimensions:
  channels: Number of channels.
  height: Number of pixels along the image height.
  width: Number of pixels along the image width.
